# What is Observability?

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing the data it produces. It enables teams to effectively troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and maintain system reliability. The three pillars of observability are metrics, logs, and traces.

# The Three Pillars of Observability 
##  Monitoring (Metrics), Logging (Logs) and Tracing (Traces) 

## 1. Monitoring (Metrics)
Monitoring involves tracking system metrics that indicate the health and performance of your system. It answers the question: "What is happening?"

Key aspects include:
```
Real-time tracking of system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
Network performance monitoring (latency, throughput, error rates)
Application-specific metrics (request rates, response times)
Alert generation based on predefined thresholds
Visualization through dashboards and charts
```
Common tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog

## 2. Logging (Logs)
Logging involves collecting detailed records of events that occur within your system. It answers the question: "Why is it happening?"
Key aspects include:
```
Structured log collection from all system components
Error and exception tracking
Authentication and authorization events
Application state changes
Debug information for troubleshooting
```
Common tools: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk

## 3. Tracing (Traces)
Tracing follows the journey of requests as they flow through different services and components. It answers the question: "How is it happening?"
Key aspects include:
```
Distributed tracing across microservices
Performance bottleneck identification
Service dependency mapping
End-to-end request flow visualization
Latency analysis at each service hop
```
Common tools: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry
