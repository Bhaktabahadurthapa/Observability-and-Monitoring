# What is Observability?

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing the data it produces. It enables teams to effectively troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and maintain system reliability. The three pillars of observability are metrics, logs, and traces.

# The Three Pillars of Observability
## 1. Monitoring (Metrics)
Monitoring involves tracking system metrics that indicate the health and performance of your system. It answers the question: "What is happening?"

Key aspects include:
```
Real-time tracking of system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
Network performance monitoring (latency, throughput, error rates)
Application-specific metrics (request rates, response times)
Alert generation based on predefined thresholds
Visualization through dashboards and charts
```
Common tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog
